#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script is displaying "Best School" 10 times


count=0

while [ $count -lt 10 ]
do
  echo "Best School"
  (( count++ ))
done
Explanation:

The script starts by initializing a counter variable to 0.
The while loop checks if the counter is less than 10. If it is, the loop body is executed.
Inside the loop, the script prints "Best School" using the echo command.
After printing, the counter is incremented by 1 using the $((counter + 1)) syntax.
The loop continues until the counter reaches 10.
Once the counter reaches 10, the loop terminates, and the script ends.
Save the script in a file, such as best_school.sh, and make it executable with the command chmod +x best_school.sh. Then, you can run the script by executing ./best_school.sh in your terminal. It will display "Best School" 10 times.
